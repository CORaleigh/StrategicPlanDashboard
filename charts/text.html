Affordable Housing Strategies
</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
Decent, affordable housing is a critical part of any community’s health. It is important to the economic vitality as affordable homes can attract and retain employees to our community, which can be a selling point and a competitive advantage for area employers. Affordable homes also allow the local workforce to live near their jobs. Shorter commutes assist with reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and expenditures on roads. The benefits of affordable housing are numerous.

Like many other large U.S. cities, Raleigh’s housing costs continue to rise. Raleigh City Council took a proactive approach to addressing the community’s affordable housing needs by approving the Affordable Housing Improvement Plan in fall 2015 and in 2016, adding one cent to the property tax rate, equaling $5.7 million, to implement the Plan.  The new revenues will primarily support Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects.

The contract for 11 city-owned parcels to be converted into affordable housing is currently being routed. Staff is currently in the process of accepting proposals for mixed-income East College Park home construction.  More than 140 residences, including single family and multi-family townhomes, will be built.

Life Expectancy by Zip Code Narrative
</h2>
<p class="text-justify"> 
As part of its work to bring awareness to the connection between neighborhood conditions and health, the [Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Society and Health](http://www.societyhealth.vcu.edu/) has calculated the life expectancy for several large U.S. cities, including the Raleigh-Durham area. The graph to the right shows the life expectancy for Raleigh zip codes. The study was unable to calculate life expectancies for the following zip codes due to insufficient data: 27517, 27607, 27695, and 27709.

Community Survey Narrative
</h2>
<p class="text-justify"> 
In winter 2016, as part of the strategic planning efforts, City Council commissioned a community survey to gain valuable feedback from Raleigh residents. This third-party administered survey used social science research standards, including random sampling, to allow for statistically-significant data on a wide variety of topics concerning the community.
