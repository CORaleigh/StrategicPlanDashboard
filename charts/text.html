<p style="text-align:Justify;">
On August 1, 2016, the City of Raleigh received a Public Protection Classification Class 1 rating, the highest rating possible, from the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO). ISO rates more than 48,000 fire protection districts across the United States and less than 0.4% hold a Class 1 rating. The Class 1 rating establishes the City of Raleigh as a superior fire protection district, and may offer the possibility of a cost savings to insurance premium payers within Raleigh’s fire protection district.

Fire protection district ratings range from a Class 1 to a Class 10. A Class 1 rating signifies the least risk for an insurer, whereas a PPC Class 10 indicates there is essentially no fire protection. ISO not only evaluates the local fire department, but also the local water distribution system and emergency communications center. The Fire Department is responsible for 50 percent of the overall score, while the Public Utilities Department’s water distribution system and the Raleigh-Wake Emergency Communications Center account for 40 percent and 10 percent respectively.
